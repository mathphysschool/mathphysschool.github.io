The Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg theorem fails in characteristic p](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5RhsIksrCU&list=PLq3E5oubNNoCGcNhGtLBf-EWJdXjAYQsq "Let X be a smooth algebraic variety over a field K, and let ∆:X→X×X be the diagonal embedding. Then the cohomology sheaves of the complex L∆∗∆∗OX are canonically identified with the sheaves of differential forms on X. In particular, there is a spectral sequence from the Hodge cohomology of X to the hypercohomology of the complex L∆∗∆∗OX. If th echaracteristic of the base field K is 0 or larger then dimX, the complex L∆∗∆∗OX is formal, i.e. quasi-isomorphic to the direct sum of its cohomology sheaves. It follows that in this case the above spectral sequence degenerates at the first page. It has been a longstanding question whether this degeneration holds in any characteristic. I will explain a recent result of Akhil Mathew showing that the analogous spectral sequence fails to degenerate for the classifying stack of the finite group scheme μp over Fp. This easily yields an example of as mooth projective projective variety X such that the spectral sequence does not degenerate.") |

The rationality problem for hypersurfaces and quadric bundles I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=116V1yBjNRs&list=PLq3E5oubNNoCGcNhGtLBf-EWJdXjAYQsq "In this series of talks, I survey recent progress on the (stable) rationality problem fo rsmooth projective hypersurfaces and quadric bundles. I explain in some detail Voisins de-generation method and its modifications due to Colliot-Thelene–Pirutka and myself. In order to apply this method, I recall some basic facts about unramified cohomology and explain the known strategies to construct unirational examples with nontrivial unramified coho-mology. The latter originated in the work of Artin–Mumford (1972) and Colliot-Thelene–Ojanguren (1989) and has more recently been used in high degree by Asok (2013) and myself. Special emphasize will be given to an example of a quadric surface bundle over P2 with non-trivial unramified degree two cohomology due to Hassett–Pirutka–Tschinkel (2016), and its generalizations to higher dimensions and higher degree unramified cohomology, found by myself.") |

I will explainthe construction of the non-archimedean Strominger–Yau–Zaslow fibration, whose existence was conjectured by Kontsevich and Soibelman in their non-archimedean approach to Mirror Symmetry. I will also explain why it is an affinoid torus fibration away from a codimension two subset of the base, as predicted by Kontsevich and Soibelman. The proof relies heavily on the Minimal Model Program in birational geometry.") |

The integral Hodge conjecture, the analogous conjecture for integral homology classes, is known to be false in general (the first counter examples were given in dimension 7 by Atiyah and Hirzebruch). I’ll survey some of the known results on this conjecture, and then present somenew counterexamples. This is joint work with Olivier Benoist") |
