A distinctive feature of this approach is that C&#42;-algebras appear only on the final stage of the construction, in contrast to the traditional approach of Woronowicz. We consider algebras of polynomial functions on classical matrix groups and, grounding on some of their properties, come to the general notion of compact Hopf &#42;-algebras, or CQG algebras. Then we consider corepresentaitons of such algebras, construct the Haar weight, and, by taking the C&#42;-completion, come to compact quantum groups in the sense of Woronowicz.") |

January 19, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_UGdgL4SHM&list=PLq3E5oubNNoBL6rqV9wdjwCObcTz02dUB "We begin by surveying classical results (mostly due to Johnson, Helemskii, and Sheinberg) on amenable Banach algebras and flat Banach modules. In particular, we prove Helemskii-Sheinberg's theorem which states that a Banach algebra A is Johnson amenable if and only if its unitization is a flat Banach A-bimodule. Next we discuss some possible extensions of these concepts to more general topological algebras and modules. The &#34;naive&#34; generalization of the notion of a flat Banach module to the nonmetrizable setting turns out to be not very useful. We suggest a modified definition, and we show how it works in concrete situations. As an application (if time permits), we give a characterization of amenable co-echelon algebras obtained in our recent perprint with Krzysztof Piszczek. Curiously, the nonmetrizable case requires some essentially new tools (as compared to the Banach case), not only from analysis, but also from homological algebra (t-structures and their hearts).") |

Drinfeld-Jimbo algebras are quantum algebras that are deformations of universal enveloping algebras in the semisimple case with quantization parameter $q$. To find the structure of their AM envelopes in the case when $&#124;q&#124;\ne 1$ we show that each continuous Banach space representation is finite dimensional. The case when $&#124;q&#124;=1$  and $q$ is not a root of unity is more complicated.&#013;In 2015 Pedchenko described the envelope for $sl&#95;2$ but he did not discuss representations. We consider completions of Verma modules, which give examples of infinite-dimensional topologically irreducible representations in this exceptional case. We also discuss the complex-analytic forms of Drinfeld-Jimbo algebras and their structure.&#013; &#013;Reference: Aristov, Banach space representations of Drinfeld-Jimbo algebras and their complex-analytic forms,   arXiv:2012.12565.") |
