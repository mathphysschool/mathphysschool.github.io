November 19, 2020](https://youtube.com/watch?v=JH2yorIgjeU&list=PLq3E5oubNNoBL6rqV9wdjwCObcTz02dUB "Bost-Connes systems are special quantum statistical dynamical systems, which provide a surprising connection between C*-algebras and number theory. We will give an overview of this area and discuss generalizations of original Bost-Connes construction to arbitrary number fields as well as results on K-theory of corresponding C*-algebras.") |

December 03, 2020](https://youtube.com/watch?v=xE_vs3sW9Cs&list=PLq3E5oubNNoBL6rqV9wdjwCObcTz02dUB "Given a family (I_x) of homogeneous ideals in the noncommutative disk algebra A, we construct a continuous Banach algebra bundle with fibers isomorphic to the quotients A/I_x. Such objects naturally appear in noncommutative complex analysis, and they can also be useful in some problems of nonformal deformation quantization. Our main tool is a theorem due to Orr Shalit and Baruch Solel, which yields a construction of completely isometric representations of the above quotients on the full Fock space.") |

December 10, 2020](https://youtube.com/watch?v=ytSnRhOrsdQ&list=PLq3E5oubNNoBL6rqV9wdjwCObcTz02dUB "We discuss an algebraic approach to compact quantum groups due to Koornwinder. A distinctive feature of this approach is that C*-algebras appear only on the final stage of the construction, in contrast to the traditional approach of Woronowicz. We consider algebras of polynomial functions on classical matrix groups and, grounding on some of their properties, come to the general notion of compact Hopf *-algebras, or CQG algebras. Then we consider corepresentaitons of such algebras, construct the Haar weight, and, by taking the C*-completion, come to compact quantum groups in the sense of Woronowicz.") |

December 17, 2020](https://youtube.com/watch?v=iEeWkDUXNyw&list=PLq3E5oubNNoBL6rqV9wdjwCObcTz02dUB "The talk summarises some results of the paper “A new knot polynomial and von Neumann algebras” by Professor Vaughan Jones (Notices of the AMS, March 1986). The goal is to explore the relation between polynomial invariants for links and von Neumann algebras in order to construct the celebrated Jones polynomial. The definition and basic properties of von Neumann algebras, subfactors and their trace will be stated. The definition of knots and their invariants, following the Artin presentation for braid groups in connection with knots will be explored. Using the relations obtained, the Jones polynomial would be defined.  The talk is dedicated to the memory of Professor Vaughan Jones who passed away on September 6, 2020.") |

January 19, 2021](https://youtube.com/watch?v=L_UGdgL4SHM&list=PLq3E5oubNNoBL6rqV9wdjwCObcTz02dUB "We begin by surveying classical results (mostly due to Johnson, Helemskii, and Sheinberg) on amenable Banach algebras and flat Banach modules. In particular, we prove Helemskii-Sheinberg's theorem which states that a Banach algebra A is Johnson amenable if and only if its unitization is a flat Banach A-bimodule. Next we discuss some possible extensions of these concepts to more general topological algebras and modules. The \"naive\" generalization of the notion of a flat Banach module to the nonmetrizable setting turns out to be not very useful. We suggest a modified definition, and we show how it works in concrete situations. As an application (if time permits), we give a characterization of amenable co-echelon algebras obtained in our recent perprint with Krzysztof Piszczek. Curiously, the nonmetrizable case requires some essentially new tools (as compared to the Banach case), not only from analysis, but also from homological algebra (t-structures and their hearts).") |

February 09, 2021](https://youtube.com/watch?v=fJ1B4DDqE5U&list=PLq3E5oubNNoBL6rqV9wdjwCObcTz02dUB "Arens-Michael envelopes, complex-analytic forms and Banach space representations of Drinfeld-Jimbo algebras   The structure of the Arens-Michael envelopes of associative algebras over $\mathbb{C}$ is known in some cases, in particular,  for the universal enveloping algebras and for some quantum algebras. Drinfeld-Jimbo algebras are quantum algebras that are deformations of universal enveloping algebras in the semisimple case with quantization parameter $q$. To find the structure of their AM envelopes in the case when $\|q\|\ne 1$ we show that each continuous Banach space representation is finite dimensional. The case when $\|q\|=1$  and $q$ is not a root of unity is more complicated. In 2015 Pedchenko described the envelope for $sl_2$ but he did not discuss representations. We consider completions of Verma modules, which give examples of infinite-dimensional topologically irreducible representations in this exceptional case. We also discuss the complex-analytic forms of Drinfeld-Jimbo algebras and their structure.

February 16, 2021](https://youtube.com/watch?v=x3iqDH1wj6I&list=PLq3E5oubNNoBL6rqV9wdjwCObcTz02dUB "In this talk, we will discuss the basics of the theory of dynamical entropy. We start with classical commutative cases and discuss several ways of defining entropy, in order to obtain a definition that can be naturally extended to noncommutative objects. We will finish with defining entropy of positive linear functionals on finite dimensional C*-algebras. In the second part of this talk (expected in February) we will further generalise this theory to more general cases of C* algebras.") |

In particular, we will reformulate the classical definition of entropy to a form that can be naturally extended to noncommutative cases. This will lead us to the notion of relative entropy for finite-dimensional C*-algebras.") |

This notion generalizes both the spectrum of an operator and the irreducible decomposition of finite groups representations. I will then define a topology and a presheaf of noncommutative holomorphic functions on the set of classes of irreducible representations of the group. I will also construct an analog of the holomorphic functional calculus in the neighborhood of the spectrum. Finally, I will share some of my ideas about possible extensions of these results to other groups and algebras.") |

We will survey some results for the cases where an explicit description has been obtained, and also discuss spaces for which partial results have been obtained. Then we will concentrate on the lattice of closed ideals in B(F), where F is one of Figiel's spaces, and prove that this lattice contains sublattices of cardinality continuum which have a rather simple description. The talk is based on papers by N. Laustsen, R. Loy and other authors.") |

We will take a short survey on some basics of knot Theory such as Gauss codes, analyze some algebraic structures of knots diagrams on the plane and how they form a very special kind of algebras. These Hopf algebras will help us to construct some of the well known quantum invariants of knots. Work based on a paper by Louis Kauffman.") |
