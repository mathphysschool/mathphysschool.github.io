Here the cycles of x are black vertices, the cycles of y are white vertices, and the cycles of z are faces. To every map one can associate two groups: the monodromy group G generated by x,y,z, and the automorphism group H. A map is called regular if these two groups are isomorphic. In this case the set E of edges can be identified with the group, and this group acts on itself by multiplications. Thus, a construction of a regular map, even a large one, may be reduced to a construction of a group with desired properties, and this group may be constructed as a monodromy group of another map, often much smaller. As an example of special interest we will consider Hurwitz maps. In 1893, Hurwitz proved that for a map of genus g more than1 the order of its automorphism group is bounded by 84(g-1). Hurwitz maps are interesting not only because they are very symmetric but also because they are very rare. Marston Conder (Aucland) classified all regular maps of genus from 2 to 101. Their number is more than 19 thousand, and only seven of them are Hurwitz. This is a joint work with Gareth Jones (Southampton).") |

Namely, for each value of $n$ pick a connected graph with $n$ vertices. Then the symmetric chromatic functions of these graphs form a basis of the algebra of symmetric function. As a family of such graphs we choose stars with $n$ vertices. Those are the trees which have one central vertex of degree $n-1$ connecting with $n-1$ leaves. I give a simple closed formula discovered by my student Ishaan Shah expressing the symmetric chromatic function of a graph in terms of this basis of symmetric chromatic function of stars.") |

Our goal is to find the Poincaré dual cohomology class of this locus. At present this problem is not fully solved, but there is a conjecture relating the cohomology class in question to Witten's r-spin class and an approach that is likely to lead to a full proof.") |

Besides, all these numbers include both simple versions as well as orbifold or double versions. These numbers are collected into generating series called n-point correlator functions. It turns out that these functions become rational after a suitable change of coordinates implied by the equation of spectral curve. This fact implies that each n-point function can be computed explicitly in a closed form. The goal of the talk is to explain the precise meaning of these assertions.") |
