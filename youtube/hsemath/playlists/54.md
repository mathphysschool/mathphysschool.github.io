In the first part of the talk I will explain few classical reasonssupporting this belief and some of the subtleties we face proving their existence. In particularreal and complex manifolds behave very differently depending on which curvature (sectional,Ricci, scalar, . . . ) one tries to make constant. In the secondpart of the talk I will focus onthe complex case, introducing some fundamental obstructions and analysing if and when fewbasic geometric operations such as Galois coverings, blow ups and resolutions of singularitiespreserve the existence of such metrics. A number of open problems will be discussed.") |

The stronger property of uniform K-stability can be checked using the recently established valuative criteria and computing a so-called delta-invariant. However, a uniformly K-stable Fano variety nesessarily has a finite automorphism group. To treat the case of a Fano variety with an action of an infinite group G, it is desirable to generalize these notions (uniform K-stabilty, valuative criterion, delta-invariant) to G-equivariant setting. In my talk I will survey a few recent works in this direction (independently, by Ziwen Zhu, Chi Li, andmyself). Also I will consider some examples, such as spherical Fano varieties and G-varieties of complexity one") |

Timashev, Characterizing unipolar flag manifolds by their varieties of minimal rational tangents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gulHFOGRRv8&list=PLq3E5oubNNoB_3xz2aeTZDk224n-eJ8be "It is well known that rational curves play a key role in the geometry of projective algebraicvarieties, especially of Fano manifolds. In particular, onFano manifolds of Picard number one,which are sometimes called unipolar, one may consider rational curves of minimal degree passingthrough general points. Tangent directions of minimal rational curves through a general pointform a projective subvariety in the projectivized tangent space, called the variety of minimalrational tangents (VMRT).In 90-s J.-M. Hwang and N. Mok developed a philosophy declaringthat the geometry of aunipolar Fano manifold is governed by the geometry of its VMRTat a general point, as anembedded projective variety. In support of this thesis, they proposed a program of character-izing unipolar flag manifolds in the class of all unipolar Fano manifolds by their VMRT. Inthe following decades a number of partial results were obtained by Mok, Hwang, and theircollaborators.Recently the program was successfully completed (J.-M. Hwang, Q. Li, and the speaker).The main result states that a unipolar Fano manifoldXwhose VMRT is isomorphic to theone of a unipolar flag manifoldYis itself isomorphic toY. Interestingly, the proof of the mainresult involves a bunch of ideas and techniques from “pure” algebraic geometry, differentialgeometry, structure and representation theory of simple Lie groups and algebras, and theory ofspherical varieties") |

The Neron–Severi group ofXover analgebraic closure of the finite field is of rank 22 and has a semisimple linear Frobenius action.The zeta function ofXis uniquely determined by the characteristic polynomial ofthis action.I will speak on a possible classification of zeta functions for supersingularK3 surfaces, and givesome examples.") |

Laterhe conjectured that every smooth proper rationally connected variety over aC1field has arational point. The conjecture is proven for finite fields (Esnault) and function fields of curvesover algebraically closed fields (Graber–Harris–de Jong–Starr), but it is still open for the max-imal unramified extensions ofp-adic fields.  I use birational geometry in characteristic 0 toreduce the conjecture to the problem of finding rational points on Fano varieties with terminalsingularities.") |

Also letL/kbe a field extention whose degree is not divisible by 2and 3. Then the surfaceX×Spec(L) has no rational points. The proof consists of the caseof del Pezzo surfaces and the case of conic bundles; we will pay significant attention to bothcases.") |
