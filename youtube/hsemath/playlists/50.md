Given a complex manifold, a real structure is nothing but an an anti-holomorphic diffeomorphism of order two of the underlying real manifold, which plays the role of complex conjugation. The fixed locus of such an involution is called a real form of the manifold, and in fact we can recover our original manifold by extension of scalars from any of its real forms. Of course, a manifold can have pairwise non-isomorphic real forms and the first problem is to decide wether there are only finitely many of them. The answer to this question is known in low dimension, i.e., for curves and surfaces, and in this talk we will provide an answer in the case where the manifold under consideration is hyperkähler, showing the finiteness (up to isomorphism) of the number of real forms in this case") |

This theory has quickly found many applications in algebraic and arithmetic geometry. In particular it turned out that there are strong and interesting connections between Berkovich spaces, birational geometry and mirror symmetry. In these talks, I will introduce the central objects of this theory: dual complexes, weight functions and essential skeletons. As an application, I will explain how the non-archimedean approach applies to the study of some degenerations of hyper-Kähler varieties, and to the study of character varieties, central objects in non-abelian Hodge theory") |
