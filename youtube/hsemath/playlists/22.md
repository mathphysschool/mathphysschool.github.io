In the 20th century, their results were justified using intersection theory. In particular, De Concini and Procesi developed the concept of the ring of conditions for (possibly) non-compact homogeneous varieties. I will define the ring of conditions and describe its applications to some classical problems of enumerative geometry. The main examples will be complex tori and Grassmannians.") |
