We consider the construction for Heisenberg algebra and the link of the obtained invariants with the equivalence classes of tangle diagrams by Reidemeister moves. The same method applies to some ribbon Hopf algebra to build the universal invariant, connected with the equivalence classes of rotational tangle diagrams by rotational Reidemeister moves. The main theorem claims that the universal invariant determines the universal quantum SL(2) invariant and, hence, all colored Jones polynomials.") |

Complex C(D) can be shown to be independent up quasi-isomorphism from a specific planar projection of the link L. Thus homology groups H(L) of the complex C(L) yield a new invariant of the link L known as Khovanov homology. A celebrated result of Khovanov is the following &#013;Theorem. The graded Poincare polynomial Kh(L)(t,q)=Σ t^i q^j dim H^{i,j}(L) is a link invariant which specifies to the unnormalized Jones polynomial of the link L at t=-1.&#013;The bulk of my talk will be dedicated to proving invariance of C(L) under Reidemeister moves of planar diagrams. Then I will prove the theorem stated above. Time permitting I will also talk about functoriality of H(L) with respect to link cobordism and Khovanov homology as 4-dimensional TQFT. &#013;The talk follows several papers. The first part can be deduced from [1]. The original paper of Khovanov [2] is also an invaluable source in understanding the theory although a slightly more difficult and unpolished one. Finally, Jacobsson's paper provides a necessary background and proof of Khovanov homology's invariance under link cobordism. Definition of 4-dimensional TQFT can be found in standard sources like the following entry on nLab [4]. &#013;References: [1] Bar-Natan, Dror. “On Khovanov’s categorification of the Jones polynomial.” Algebraic & Geometric Topology 2.1 (2002): 337-370. &#013;[2] Khovanov, Mikhail. “A categorification of the Jones polynomial.” Duke Mathematical Journal 101.3 (2000): 359-426. &#013;[3] Jacobsson, Magnus. “An invariant of link cobordisms from Khovanov homology.” Algebraic \& Geometric Topology 4.2 (2004): 1211-1251. &#013;[4] nLab authors. “4d-TQFT.” (November 2021).") |

There is a deep connection between meanders and Temperley-Lieb algebras, statistical physics models, and moduli spaces of complex curves. Despite the high interest in this area, the central questions remain open. The number of meanders with a given number of intersections, as well as the asymptotic behaviour of these numbers are unknown. We are going to discuss some basic facts about meanders, in particular the problems of meander enumeration. We also will describe the recently discovered geometric decomposition of the meanders into irreducible components. This decomposition leads us to a new approach to the meander enumeration problem.") |

Such a homomorphism is uniquely determined by its values on primitive elements in the Hopf algebra of graphs. These values are very simple, since they also are primitive elements, hence linear polynomials. Hence, understanding primitive elements plays a crucial role in understanding polynomial graph invariants. In particular, we will discuss the projection of the Hopf algebra of graphs to its primitive subspace.") |

There are many graph invariants possessing this property, which hints that disjoint union can be considered as a multiplication operation on graphs. Moreover, it makes sense to allow adding linear combinations of graphs, and extending multiplication by linearity to linear combinations we obtain an algebra of graphs. Probably even more interesting is the operation of comultiplication on this algebra, which makes it into a Hopf algebra. These algebraic structures and their relationship with 4-term relations will be discussed in the talk.") |

In addition to 4-term relations, it satisfies so-called 6-term relations. Algorithms based on the 6-term relations in practice compute only values on chord diagrams of small order and for some simple sequences of diagrams, due to the rapid growth of the number of intermediate chord diagrams. S.K.Lando formulated a conjecture about the form of the values of the sl(2)-weight system on chord diagrams with complete intersection graphs. We suggest a simple inductive algorithm for calculating these values, which is based on calculation of values on very few intermediate chord diagrams. The results agree with the predictions of Lando’s conjecture.") |
